## Intriduction

This is a power BI project on covid19 analysis on global confirmed cases all over the world. 
The aim of the project is to analyze the prevalence of covid19 cases in the world and drive insights to answer important questions regarding the novel virus in order to stop the spread of the virus.

**_Disclaimer_**: _The dataset was extracted raw from CSSEGIS online GitHub repository CSV file and do not represent the actual data as at the me you are reading this. The data is from 2020 to March 2023. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the capability of power BI._

## Problem statement:

1.	Which top 5 countries has the highest prevalence of covid19 cases since the outbreak of the novel virus
2.	Which Bottom 5 countries has the lowest prevalence of covid19 cases since the outbreak of the novel virus
3.	What is the total confirmed cases?
4.	What is the fatality rate since inception of the virus?

 ## Data Sourcing
 
It was when I came up with the above questions I went to source the raw dataset from the web.
The raw dataset was scrap from the web using excel
I copy the link to the link to the raw dataset and extract the data using excel. 

## Skills/concepts demonstrated

- Covid-19 picture icons
- Text box
- colour theme
- Filter for (Yearly, Monthly, and daily cases) were applied.

## Visualizations:

#The visualization comprises of 5 tables;

1.	top Country with the highest prevalence of (confirmed Cases) of covid-19 cases
2.	Bottom 5 countries with the lowest Prevalence of (confirmed Cases) of Covid-19
3.	Yearly Cumulative confirmed Cases of Covid-19 since 2020
4.	Monthly cumulative confirmed Cases of Covid-19 since 2020
5.	Covid-19 Icons
